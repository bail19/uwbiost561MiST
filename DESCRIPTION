Title: Set-Based Mixed Effects Score Tests for Assessing Genetic
        Association between SNPs and Phenotype
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Yu-Ru Su, Li Hsu
Maintainer: Yu-Ru Su <piccoloegg@gmail.com>
Description: Functions to implement set-based score tests for association of a set of SNPs with either continuous or dichotomous outcomes under mixed effects models. It includes burden-type test allowing for external weights for each SNP in the set, variance component-based association test, and three combination tests, oMiST, aMiST and fMiST, based on combinations of the previous two tests. Set-level pvalues are produced and returned.
